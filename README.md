This is explaining how to add a file.

We also checked to make sure our username and email address is setup properly within the local machines.

git clean -nd: Will show which files will be removed is not added, i.e., in the local machine or the staging area
git clean -fd: Will remove any files that is not added, i.e., in the local machine or the staging area
git reset: Will remove any files from the staging area. This means if we add any files by git add -A command, we can hit git reset to unstage them
